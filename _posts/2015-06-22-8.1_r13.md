The config bar has been completely rebuilt, and is now the exclusive spot for all HuD configuration. The HuD section of the Advanced Options have been merged into the Config Bar. Any options in the Config Bar that aren't directly related to the HuD were moved to Advanced Options.

The primary goal here is to make it easier to access options for specific sections of the HuD. Previously if you wanted to move eg. the player frame, there was an option in the Positions tab and offsets in the Adv Options. Now, both of these are in a specific Player section of the Unit Frames tab. This follows for every section of the HuD.


## Aura Tracker</br>![break](http://i.imgur.com/vwV6Cwv.png)##
While this update was primarily focused on the new config bar, a few tweaks were made to the AuraTracker.

First, it will now look primarily for spell IDs before checking the spell name. This allows for more accurate spell matching. It also allows for much better support for tracker with multiple spells like Tigereye Brew. There is also now a priority for multi-spell trackers with the leftmost spell taking precedence if the aura is present.

Finally, Druid forms support was removed and all trackers that use this setting will be converted to use the associated spec. This was done to help simplify the tracker config, and the fact that most of the important spells can only be learned by one spec.

The [Useful Links](http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?t=49761) sticky was updated to now include a [road map](https://trello.com/b/RFkZ6nSE/roadmap) of where RealUI is going. This is hosted on Trello and while an account is not needed to view the board, it will be required to vote and comment.
